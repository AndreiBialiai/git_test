I've paid my dues
Time after time.
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime.
And bad mistakes‒
I've made a few.
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through.

And I need to go on and on, and on, and on.

We are the champions, my friends.
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end.
We are the champions.
We are the champions.
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions of the world.
